# <Pre Work Study Guide Pages>

## Description

This project was to practice HTML/CSS/JS skills prior to starting the bootcamp. I learnt how to write basic HTML/CSS and how to link CSS/JS to my HTML. I also learnt functions and if statements in JS.

## Installation

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git so that we can refer back to this going forward. If I open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It lists the topics I learned from prework and will choose one topic for me to study first.
